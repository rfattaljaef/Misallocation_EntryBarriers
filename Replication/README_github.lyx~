\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this note I describe the content of the replication materials to reproduce
 quantitative results and recreate figures in the published manuscript.
 The raw firm-level data cannot be disclosed, but I shall provide the relevant
 statistics that are used in the computation of the various numerical exercises.
 These statistics are loaded by the computation files and are used as ingredient
s for the identification of entry barriers and the implementation of counterfact
uals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The replication materials are composed of three main files that compute
 the equilibrium allocations and create the figures illustrating the results:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
master_avs10_ind_weighted_reg_tr5.f90
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
master_avs10_ind_weighted_reg_tr5_dbindicator.f90
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
replication_figures.R
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below, I explain the use of each file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Quantitative Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main files for the computation of the numerical exercises.
 The first one identifies the model-based entry barrier and computes allocations
 under various combinations of distortions (that is, undistorted, distorted
 with both distortions, and distorted with one distortion and a time).
 The second one solves the same allocations but adopting the World Bank's
 Doing Business Indicator's measure of entry barriers, translated into model-equ
ivalent labor units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Baseline Quantitative results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file performing the identification of entry barriers is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
master_avs10_ind_weighted_reg_tr5.f90
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file is compiled using Gfortran, the GNU Fortran compiler for Linux
 distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As inputs to the computation, the files loads the average firm size across
 countries and the WLS regression coefficient between 
\begin_inset Formula $log\left(TFPR\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $log\left(TFPQ\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The files containing this information are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
avsize10_usa_weight.txt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
regcoeff_weighted_reg_tr5.txt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As said, the average firm size is computed conditional on the sample of
 10+ worker firms in each country.
 Furthermore 2 digit average firm sizes are aggregated, within each country,
 according to the US distribution of firms across 2-digit industries, as
 explain in the manuscript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slope of the idiosyncratic distortion profile is given by the WLS estimate
 of the regression between 
\begin_inset Formula $log\left(TFPR\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $log\left(TFPQ\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $TFPR$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $TFPQ$
\end_inset

 are demeaned by their respective 4-digit averages.
 Furthermore, prior to the regression, the tails of the distribution of
 
\begin_inset Formula $TFPR$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $TFPQ$
\end_inset

 are trimmed at the 5%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantitative Results under World Bank's Doing Business Indicators' Entry
 Barrier
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar code solves the equilibrium allocations under the various combination
 of distortions inputing the entry barrier from the World Bank's Doing Business
 Indicators.
 The file is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
master_avs10_ind_weighted_reg_tr5_dbindicator.f90
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file is compiled using Gfortran, the GNU Fortran compiler for Linux
 distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get at a model equivalent entry cost from the Doing Business Indicator
 (DBI), we proceed as follows.
 We start by adding the total cost of starting a firm and acquiring electricity
 as a proportion of income per capita from the Doing Business Database,
 
\begin_inset Formula $DB=\frac{\left(Start+Electricity\right)}{\left(Y/L\right)}$
\end_inset

 .
 Multiplying the DBI by the inverse of the labor share, which we take from
 the Penn World Table version 9.0, we get the level of the cost of entry
 in units of labor: 
\begin_inset Formula $DB^{L}=\left(\frac{start+electricity}{Y/L}\right)*\frac{Y}{w*L}=\left(\frac{start+electricity}{W}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Expressed in this fashion, the Doing Businessâ€™s cost of entry is comparable
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{e}\tau^{e}$
\end_inset

 in the model.
 Thus, to isolate the Doing Business counterpart of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{E}$
\end_inset

, we divide 
\begin_inset Formula $DB^{L}$
\end_inset

 by the calibrated value of the technological component of the cost of entry,
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{e}$
\end_inset

 ( i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{DB}^{E}=\frac{DB^{L}}{f_{e}}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file collecting the DBI's cost of starting a firm in units of labor,which
 is loaded by the Fortran file, is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Section
Figures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, the replication materials provide a file for the creation of all
 the figures reported in the paper.
 The file name is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
replication_figures.R
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file is was created in 
\begin_inset Formula $R-Studio$
\end_inset

 Version 1.0.153 for Linux.
 Required libraries are declared at the beginning of the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the input files that are loaded for the construction of the figures
 are provided as part of the replication materials.

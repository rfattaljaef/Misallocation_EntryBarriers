The data for this project is composed of the various firm-level databases,
 the Penn World Tables for aggregate data, the Doing Business Indicators
 for the regulation based barriers to entry, and the Small Business Administrati
on for inferring the US's distribution of firm shares across 2 digit industries.

\begin_layout Subsection
Penn World Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paper uses data from the Penn World Tables version 9.0 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 Data can be downloaded from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subset of data from Penn World Tables 9.0 utilized in the project is
 recorded in the following files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
GDP_percapita_sector_analysis.csv for the real GDP per capita in the year
 2014 for the 21 countries in the sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ctfp_pwt.dat for the PPP based measure of TFP in the year 2014 for the 21
 countries in the sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
pwt90_gdp_kstock.csv allows to compute TFP for the countries for which the
 Penn World Table's own computation of PPP based TFP is missing.
 As stated in the manuscript, in countries with missing data the TFP was
 computed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{Y}{K^{1/3}L^{2/3}}$
\end_inset

, using 
\begin_inset Formula $rgdpna$
\end_inset

 as the real GDP, 
\begin_inset Formula $rkna$
\end_inset

 as the real capital stock, and 
\begin_inset Formula $emp$
\end_inset

 as the labor input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
pwt_labshare_2014.csv allows to transform the World Bank's Doing Business
 Indicator's cost of starting a firm in model equivalent units (see below)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first first file was created straight from the PWT's excel sheet, defining
 GDP per capita as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{rgdpna}{pop}$
\end_inset

, and filtering countries to keep only the 21 countries under study in the
 paper.
 Similarly, the third and forth files are also filtered from the original
 PWT databse.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Entry_Costs_sector_analysis.csv reports the costs of starting a firm and
 the cost of accessing electricity in the year 2014, as proportion of GDP
 per capita, for the 21 countries in the sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
db_indicator_laborunits.txt reports these entry costs, translated into model-equi
valent entry costs in units of labor, as explained in the manuscript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first file was constructed simply by filtering the full database by
 country in the year 2014, and selecting the 21 countries under study in
 the paper.
 Then, across all doing business metrics, we select the ones for the constructio
n of the costs of starting a formal firm, given by:

\begin_layout Itemize
cost of starting a business, as % of income per capita, labeled start_gdp
 in the replication file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
cost of getting electricity as % of income per capita, labeled electr_gdp
 in the replication file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
totalec_gdp in the replication file is simply the addition of the above

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the raw firm level data, some of which are accessible and
 some are not, the replication repository offers all the aggregate statistics
 computed from the firm-level data that are necessary for the inference
 of entry barriers and computation of counterfactuals.
 Hence, readers should be able to replicate the results, given these inputs,
 from the computational codes described later.
 More information on data sources can be found in the Data Appendix of the
 manuscript.

\begin_layout Section
Quantitative Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main files for the computation of the numerical exercises.
 The first one identifies the model-based entry barrier and computes allocations
 under various combinations of distortions (that is, undistorted, distorted
 with both distortions, and distorted with one distortion and a time).
 The second one solves the same allocations but adopting the World Bank's
 Doing Business Indicator's measure of entry barriers, translated into model-equ
ivalent labor units.
 A third file is provided for the simulation of the life-cycle dynamics
 of firms

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file is compiled using gfortran, the GNU Fortran compiler for Linux
 distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As inputs to the computation, the files loads the average firm size across
 countries and the WLS regression coefficient between 
\begin_inset Formula $log\left(TFPR\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $log\left(TFPQ\right)$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As said, the average firm size is computed conditional on the sample of
 10+ worker firms in each country.
 Furthermore 2 digit average firm sizes are aggregated, within each country,
 according to the US distribution of firms across 2-digit industries, as
 explain in the manuscript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slope of the idiosyncratic distortion profile is given by the WLS estimate
 of the regression between 
\begin_inset Formula $log\left(TFPR\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $log\left(TFPQ\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $TFPR$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $TFPQ$
\end_inset

 are demeaned by their respective 4-digit averages.
 Furthermore, prior to the regression, the tails of the distribution of
 
\begin_inset Formula $TFPR$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $TFPQ$
\end_inset

 are trimmed at the 5%

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantitative Results under World Bank's Doing Business Indicators' Entry
 Barrier
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar code solves the equilibrium allocations under the various combination
 of distortions imputing the entry barrier from the World Bank's Doing Business
 Indicators.
 The file is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
master_avs10_ind_weighted_reg_tr5_dbindicator.f90
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file is compiled using gfortran, the GNU Fortran compiler for Linux
 distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get at a model equivalent entry cost from the Doing Business Indicator
 (DBI), we proceed as follows.
 We start by adding the total cost of starting a firm and acquiring electricity
 as a proportion of income per capita from the Doing Business Database,
 
\begin_inset Formula $DB=\frac{\left(Start+Electricity\right)}{\left(Y/L\right)}$
\end_inset

 .
 Multiplying the DBI by the inverse of the labor share, which we take from
 the Penn World Table version 9.0, we get the level of the cost of entry
 in units of labor: 
\begin_inset Formula $DB^{L}=\left(\frac{start+electricity}{Y/L}\right)*\frac{Y}{w*L}=\left(\frac{start+electricity}{W}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Expressed in this fashion, the Doing Business’s cost of entry is comparable
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{e}\tau^{e}$
\end_inset

 in the model.
 Thus, to isolate the Doing Business counterpart of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{E}$
\end_inset

, we divide 
\begin_inset Formula $DB^{L}$
\end_inset

 by the calibrated value of the technological component of the cost of entry,
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{e}$
\end_inset

 ( i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{DB}^{E}=\frac{DB^{L}}{f_{e}}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file collecting the DBI's cost of starting a firm in units of labor,which
 is loaded by the Fortran file, is given by

 for a subset of countries in the sample.
 These life-cycles are first simulated using the following Fortran file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
life_cycles_weighted_reg_tr5.f90
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This program loads the productivity, employment, and innovation profiles
 across productivity levels across countries, under their given pair of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Av_Size_bySector_All_short_WeightedReg_tr5.csv
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the firm-level data that allows for the computation of average firm
 size is to a large extent confidential, I provide the 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 code that computes the average firm size for one of the countries where
 the firm-level data is publicly available, Chile.

\begin_layout Subsection
Employment Histograms of Firm Size Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As validating evidence for the mechanisms in the model, figure 3 in the
 article shows the share of firms with 250 workers or more across countries
 in the sample.
 Continuing with Chile as example of program that allows to replicate the
 construction of the cumulative distribution function from which the shares
 are computed, the repository provides the following file for replication:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
employment_histograms_chile.R
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This R-file constructs histograms of the firm size distribution with employment
 bins that are comparable to the bins reported in the Small Business Administrat
ion and the Business Dynamics Statistics databases.
 After constructing the cumulative distribution functions corresponding
 to the size bins, the file then computes the share of firms with 250 workers
 or more.
 The output of this computation, applied to the Census-based and Amadeus-based
 databases, which are in turn taken as ingredients in the replication_figures.R
 file for the construction of figure 3, are the following:
